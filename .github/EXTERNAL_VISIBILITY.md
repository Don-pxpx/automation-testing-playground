# External visibility — only this repo

This repository is the **only public automation testing POC** intended for external viewers (e.g. recruiters, LinkedIn visitors). No other repositories are required or linked from here.

## For the repo owner: keep it that way

To ensure external users **cannot see or access** your other repos:

### 1. Make other repos private

On GitHub:

- Go to **each other repository** (e.g. Bots-sandbox, pentesting-playground, ai-security-qa-agent, etc.).
- **Settings** → **General** → **Danger Zone** → **Change repository visibility** → **Private**.

Only **automation-testing-playground** should be **Public**.

### 2. Control what appears on your profile

- **Profile pinned repos**: On your GitHub profile, use **Customize your pins** and pin **only** `automation-testing-playground`. Do not pin or feature other repos.
- **Profile “Featured” section**: If you use it, feature only this repo or leave it empty.

### 3. Links you share

- When sharing on LinkedIn or elsewhere, use **only** the URL of this repo:  
  `https://github.com/<your-username>/automation-testing-playground`
- Do not link to other repos from this README or docs (already enforced in this repo).

### 4. Org vs personal account

- If this repo is under an **organization**, ensure the org’s default visibility for new repos is **Private**, and that only this repo is set to **Public**.
- If it’s under a **personal account**, only this repo should be Public; all others Private.

---

**Summary:** One public repo (this one), all others private, and only this repo linked or featured for external viewers.
