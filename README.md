👋🏽 Hi, I’m Sizwe

**QA Engineer | Automation Architect-in-the-Making | AI Agent Explorer**

---

🌿 **This repo is my sandbox.**

It’s where I sharpen my automation skills and prototype clean, intelligent, and maintainable test strategies — not just scripts that “pass.”

I treat testing like engineering. My questions aren’t just:
> “Does it work?”  
but:  
- 🧱 *How clean is the test architecture?*  
- 🔁 *Can it scale and repeat reliably?*  
- 🚨 *How early can I detect failures — and why?*  
- 🔮 *Can I design for change, not just for now?*

---

🚀 **On this repo, you’ll find me focusing on:**

- ✅ Building maintainable test frameworks (modular locators, configs, data-driven patterns)
- 🤖 Exploring AI-assisted testing agents (self-healing tests, adaptive test flows)
- 📘 Crafting expressive, human-readable test reports (emoji logs, clean assertions, visibility)
- 🔐 Experimenting with early security validation (auth flows, form guards, boundary checks)
- 🧠 Automating with intention — *not just speed, but clarity and strategy*

---

🌱 **What I’m currently building:**

- [`automation-testing-playground`](https://github.com/Don-pxpx/automation-testing-playground)  
  My structured test lab: login, cart logic, flexible checkout flows, test cleanup.  
  Built with reusable components, data-layer flexibility, and emoji-powered reporting.

- `Bots-sandbox` *(private)*  
  Where I explore AI/LLM-powered testing agents and smart automation tools.

⚙️ Why I build this way
Because test automation should help you test faster — but also make it fun, challenging, and meaningful.
This playground isn’t just about passing checks — it’s where I explore smarter workflows, AI tooling, and early security testing strategies.
