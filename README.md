### 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Sizwe  
QA Engineer | Automation Architect-in-the-Making | AI Agent Explorer  

---

🧪 **This GitHub is my lab.**  
I use it to sharpen my automation skills and build smart, scalable testing workflows.

My approach to testing isn’t just “does it work” — it’s:
- **How well is it built?**
- **How repeatable is it?**
- **How fast can I catch it when it breaks?**
- **How do I future-proof it?**

---

🚀 **What I focus on here:**
- ✅ Modular & maintainable test frameworks (clean locators, configs, data files)
- 🤖 Building AI-assisted testing agents (exploring smarter, self-healing test strategies)
- 📊 Meaningful test reporting (emoji logs, readable assertions, real visibility)
- 🔐 Early security testing experiments (auth flows, form validation, boundary tests)
- 🧠 Creating automation that's actually smart — not just fast

---

🧩 **Repos I'm working on:**
- [`automation-testing-playground`](https://github.com/Don-pxpx/automation-testing-playground)  
  A full-stack test lab: login, cart flows, checkout, removals, real test structure.
- `Bots-sandbox` *(private)*  
  A personal sandbox for AI/LLM-based test agents and future automation tools.

---

🛠️ **Why I build this way:**  
Because test automation should *help you think better*, not just run faster.
